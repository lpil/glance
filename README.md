A Gleam source code parser, in Gleam!

Glance attempts to be permissive with regards to what it will parse and so it is
able to parse some code that the Gleam compiler will reject as invalid.

## Usage

Add the package to your Gleam project:

```sh
gleam add glance
```

Then get parsing!

```gleam
import glance
import gleam/io

const code = "
  pub type Cardinal {
    North
    East
    South
    West
  }
"

pub fn main() {
  let assert Ok(parsed) = glance.module(code)
  io.debug(parsed.custom_types)
}
```

This program print this to the console:
  
```gleam
[
  CustomType(
    name: "Cardinal",
    publicity: Public,
    parameters: [],
    variants: [
      Variant("North", []),
      Variant("East", []),
      Variant("South", []),
      Variant("West", []),
    ],
  ),
]
```
